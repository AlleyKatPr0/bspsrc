## Installation
To install BSPSource, you can choose from two different types of installations.

If you do not have Java 19+ installed and correctly configured, you will need to download either [bspsrc-windows.zip](https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases/download/<tag>/bspsrc-windows.zip) or [bspsrc-linux.zip](https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases/download/<tag>/bspsrc-linux.zip), depending on your operating system. These standalone installations do not require any additional software to be installed on your computer.

Alternatively, if you already have Java 19+ installed on your system, you can download [bspsrc-jar-only.zip](https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases/download/<tag>/bspsrc-jar-only.zip), which will allow you to run BspSource on any system with Java 19+ installed.
